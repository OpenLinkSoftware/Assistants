The OPAL API Playground HTML-based Single Page Application (SPA), with OAuth 2.1 support, provides a platform for exercising OPAL's APIs. Notably, it doubles as a demonstration of an application that leverages the power of loose coupling across the following key elements:

1. **Identity** – standardized identifiers (e.g., hyperlinks)  
2. **Identification** – NetID or WebID for self-sovereign identity  
3. **Authentication** – OAuth 2.1 combined with protocols like RelMeAuth, IndieAuth, etc.  
4. **Authorization** – Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies  
5. **Storage** – via respective APIs for databases, knowledge bases/graphs, filesystems, etc.
