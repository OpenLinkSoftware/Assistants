# Assistants

## What?
A collection of JSON configuration documents, based on a common JSON Schema, compatible with most large language models (LLMs) that support external function calling (e.g., OpenAI, Mistral). These documents describe the behavior of various Smart Agents (Assistants).

## Why?
To enable conversational access to functionality encapsulated in OpenAI-compliant web services via LLMs.

## How?
These configurations can be used as OpenLink AI Layer (OPAL) Assistant modules deployed via Virtuoso or deployed to the OpenAI CustomGPT store.
